# things to investigate: 
    in model.py
        test - this is where actual inferrence is defined (is called ). which is called from train.py 
    in diffusion.py - heavily modify 
        p_sample_loop
        p_losses
    in diffusion.py - never used functions (because we never use DDPM like we should have )
        set_new_noise_schedule
        q_mean_variance
        p_mean_variance
