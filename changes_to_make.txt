[X] remove voxelmorph (field_fn) 
[X] change number of output channels to 2 in DDPM  - flow and noise
[-] [decided to simplify to one noise] create double noise loss 
[X] add VM loss for field smoothness to DDPM  
[?] add VM loss for cross correlation similarity to DDPM -> check if correct calculation of output (i.e. how do we compute S_reg, given S and deformation field)
[later] change cross correlation into two losses where we compare only available lines... -> reconsider later
[] add backward step (calculate X_(t-1)) 
[later] consider what lambda we should use...
